## OVERVIEW

<br />

> ### 👉 MY MOTIVATION
> <br />
> So, recently i graduated from highschool and in comemoration i will make a little party with a few friends.
> I made this type of invite for three reasons: <br />
> <br />
> 1. I want to do something different as an invitation <br />
> <br />
> 2. I want to test the little knowledge i have in coding and programming <br />
> <br />
> 3. In highschool as my final project i made a react native app and i liked the framework so i decided to use the library version for the first time <br />
>

> ### 👉 STRUGGLES
> <br />
> Since this is a very linear project a i didn't found a major problem but its was quite difficult to pass the user picture from one page to another without a server,
> thankfully my dumb brain was able to remember that i can use the <code>localStorage</code>  web api to do that. <br />
><br />
> I did this in five days and i know it's not perfect and i am not a coding expert but after all it was fun 🐱‍💻.
